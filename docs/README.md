# Babel Documentation Map

This file answers one question: which document should be trusted for what?

## Canonical

| Document | Authority |
| --- | --- |
| [`ROADMAP.md`](../ROADMAP.md) | The only active implementation plan and status map. |
| [`CONTEXT.md`](../CONTEXT.md) | Canonical names and boundaries for the product, renderer, qualification work, archives, corpus, and benchmark. |
| [`AGENTS.md`](../AGENTS.md) | Repository operating contract for coding agents. |
| [`README.md`](../README.md) | Product overview and local-use guide. |
| [`server/babelParser/systemInstruction.js`](../server/babelParser/systemInstruction.js) and [`prompts.js`](../server/babelParser/prompts.js) | Model-facing authored contract. |
| [`docs/implementation/invention-boundary.md`](implementation/invention-boundary.md) | Deterministic compiler and elaboration boundary. |
| [`docs/implementation/baselines/provider-free-baseline-spec.md`](implementation/baselines/provider-free-baseline-spec.md) | Provider-free baseline contract. |
| [`docs/design/visual-relations-tier2-shape-dispatch-spec.md`](design/visual-relations-tier2-shape-dispatch-spec.md) | Verified Tier-2 renderer specification. |
| [`docs/design/visual-relations-renderer-closeout-2026-08-25.md`](design/visual-relations-renderer-closeout-2026-08-25.md) | Renderer completion receipt. |

## Supporting Implementation Records

- [`derivationalDatabase/README.md`](../derivationalDatabase/README.md): exact
  scope of the persistence-free W17a-d record layer.
- [`bench/README.md`](../bench/README.md): exact scope of provider-free W13-W16
  benchmark plumbing.
- [`docs/design/benchmark-provenance-conditions.md`](design/benchmark-provenance-conditions.md):
  benchmark provenance conditions.
- [`docs/implementation/case-retirement-census.md`](implementation/case-retirement-census.md):
  completed case-metadata retirement evidence.

## Renderer Research Archive

The remaining `docs/design/visual-relations-*` research notes, inventories,
source records, and proof pages explain how the renderer was developed. They
are useful provenance, not open tasks. The closeout and Tier-2 specification
above are authoritative for current behavior.

Some of those historical notes refer to locally recovered copies of academic
figures under `docs/design/visual-relations-assets/`. Those third-party copies
are intentionally not distributed; the notes retain their source citations and
links as the release record.

The public artifact is [`docs/research/relation-orchard/`](research/relation-orchard/).

## History

`docs/history/` preserves old plans, Mac handoffs, checkpoints, audit ledgers,
and reviewer receipts. Historical text is intentionally not rewritten to look
current. Read the README beside each history set before using it.

The [Fable Zero Unknowns packet](history/architecture/fable-zero-unknowns-2026-07-17/README.md)
is a primary architecture source preserved in full. Its
[live reconciliation audit](history/architecture/2026-07-fable-packet-audit.md)
maps the packet's decisions, residual unknowns, W0-W18 program, and later
workspace plan to live code and the master roadmap.

## Generated And Local-Only Material

- `.artifacts/`: ignored research outputs. Only explicitly unignored harness
  entrypoints and helpers belong to the repository.
- `bench-baseline/`: local benchmark baseline output.
- `dist/`: frontend build output.
- `test-results/`: browser/test output.
- `docs/design/*.bundle.js`: generated renderer bundles. Only the current
  immutable Orchard bundle survives; Tier-2 review output is rebuilt on demand.

Default verification must use committed files under `fixtures/` and `tests/`,
never an ignored local artifact directory.
