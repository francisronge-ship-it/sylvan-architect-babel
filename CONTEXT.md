# Babel Context

Babel turns model-authored syntactic derivations into inspectable, replayable,
durable analyses. This glossary separates the released research artifact from
the product and evaluation work that still remains.

## Language

**Babel product**:
The not-yet-shipped application comprising the public syntax generator and the
research workbench over one shared contract, engine, renderer, Tree Bank, and
derivational record system. Its roadmap is a minimum product boundary, not a
frozen feature list.
_Avoid_: Relation Orchard, research release

**Relation Orchard**:
The already-published research artifact that presents Babel's curated relation
fixtures and visual vocabulary. It demonstrates the renderer but is not the
Babel product or an end-to-end provider-integration proof.
_Avoid_: Babel product, Atlas

**Renderer subsystem**:
The deterministic Tier 1, Tier 2, and Tier 3 relation renderer and Replay
behavior verified provider-free against committed fixtures.
_Avoid_: complete Babel renderer integration

**Renderer integration**:
The complete path from provider-authored contract output through normalization,
compilation, Replay, and rendering inside the shipped Babel product.
_Avoid_: renderer subsystem

**Contract qualification**:
Pre-launch empirical testing of whether selected providers reliably produce
usable Babel analyses under the model-facing contract.
_Avoid_: benchmark

**Public generation policy**:
The single empirically selected model and settings that power the public syntax
generator without exposing provider controls to ordinary users.
_Avoid_: research model picker

**Research model access**:
Explicit provider, model, and native-control access for inspecting and comparing
runs across proprietary and open-weight candidates. Francis chooses every model
in the configured catalog. Every route must meet the same product-quality
standard even though model analyses may differ.
_Avoid_: public generation policy

**Babel product launch**:
Programs 0 through 6 working together in production: qualified generation, the
shared public and research application, complete renderer integration, durable
Personal Tree Bank work, bounded operations, the Generation Archive, and a
working review path into the Reviewed Derivational Corpus. A large reviewed
corpus and the benchmark are not launch requirements.
_Avoid_: Relation Orchard publication, benchmark release

**Benchmark**:
The deferred, claim-bearing evaluation of model syntactic performance that
requires qualified review, methods authority, and independently reconstructable
evidence.
_Avoid_: contract qualification, product verification

**Personal Tree Bank**:
The user's browser-local library of explicitly saved Babel work, annotations,
collections, and exports. Saving or deleting here does not control backend
research retention by the official hosted service.
_Avoid_: Generation Archive, Reviewed Derivational Corpus

**Generation Archive**:
The official hosted service's automatic backend record of generation attempts,
including successful analyses and separately typed failed or malformed outputs.
It is not an initial ordinary-user interface.
_Avoid_: Personal Tree Bank, Reviewed Derivational Corpus

**Reviewed Derivational Corpus**:
The human-selected collection of research- and training-grade complete
derivations promoted from archived generations with evidence and provenance.
This is a technical working name; public branding remains unresolved.
_Avoid_: Generation Archive, final-tree treebank

**Failed generation**:
A provider attempt that does not become a valid Babel analysis because of
transport, malformed data, contract, or deterministic-engine failure. A valid
analysis of an ungrammatical sentence is not a failed generation.
_Avoid_: illicit analysis, corrupt sentence
